Ice Walker Game
=================

This project is a game which goal is to **bring the main**
**player on the final cell**. The other players are here to
help the main player to reach his goal. They can only
move to the **north**, **east**, **south** and **west**, until they
are stuck by a wall. Here's a documentation of the
different modules used to create this game
